**Usage**
\
\
Bold enemy if they are close by to help people see better (think of it as crypto's drone release check)

Visual Check checks if enemy is in sight
```
//store this somewhere globally:
float visiblePlayerInfo[75] = {};
 
 
//do this to know if visible or not:
bool visible = false;
float LastVisibleTime = 0.f;
read<float>(entity + OFFSET_LAST_VISIBLE_TIME, &LastVisibleTime);
 
visible = LastVisibleTime > 0.f && LastVisibleTime > visiblePlayerInfo[index];
visiblePlayerInfo[index] = LastVisibleTime;
```

Change color spectrum for difference enemies, according to the enemy's shield level

Teammate exception: teammates are labelled in special color, so player can avoid shooting at teammates and bullets getting blocked

Aim assist: tracks enemy with movement and bullet travel prediction.(based on enemy's movement when the bullet is shot, also keeps track of bullet projectile)

Spectator count: tells how many people are spectating you even in rank

**Instructions**

1. download the release and compile code to get the EFI mapper

2. find an injector yourself, whether it's interception or extreme, whatever

4. restart the computer and choose to boot with the usb drive\
follow these steps

```
FS0:
load memory.efi
FS1:
1. ls (check if there's efi and boot file)
> if no
fs3: -> check, fs3: ->check, etc
> if you found it
cd efi
2. ls (check if there's Microsoft)
> if no
back to step 1
> yes
cd Microsoft
look for mgftwboot.efi and type it in the shell
```
